## 5.2 Why is the Project Important?

### 🚨Problem Statement

- In today’s fast-paced ride service industry, passenger comfort and safety are often compromised in favor of speed and efficiency. Many platforms lack a structured, meaningful feedback system that captures the rider’s full experience beyond just star ratings. As a result:

    - Passengers feel unheard or helpless in influencing driver behavior.

    - Drivers receive inadequate or vague feedback, limiting their ability to improve.

    - Platforms fail to identify and address patterns of poor service or risky behavior.

    - This gap results in declining trust, inconsistent ride quality, and unsafe travel experiences. 


### ✅ TASC provide a simple solution.
- Providing a passenger-first platform where riders can:

    - Give structured feedback after each ride

    - Help shape driver ratings and performance standards

    - Drive a culture of accountability and empathy in ride services

## Market need and opportunity


### 📈 Market Need
### 🚗1. Growing Reliance on Ride Services
- Urban and semi-urban populations increasingly depend on ride-hailing apps (Ola, Uber, etc.) for daily commutes.

- With convenience comes rising concern about passenger safety, comfort, and driver behavior.

### 💬 2. Feedback Systems Are Surface-Level

- Most ride apps use simple star ratings and generic comments, which often fail to capture the real quality of rides.

- Passengers lack influence over the system once a ride ends — leading to dissatisfaction and distrust.

### ⚠️ 3. Safety Incidents Are Underreported

- Many passengers avoid reporting unsafe or aggressive behavior because the process is not easy or impactful.

- There's a need for a dedicated, focused platform to report, analyze, and address such concerns.

## 🪟 Market Opportunity

### 🎯 1. Passenger-Centric Differentiation

- TASC can fill the void by offering a dedicated platform for passengers to share in-depth feedback, influencing driver ratings and promoting safer driving practices.

### 🌍 2. Integration with Existing Services

- By partnering with ride-hailing companies, TASC can integrate its feedback system to enhance service quality and passenger satisfaction.

### 📊 3. Data-Driven Safety Standards
Rich passenger feedback can power AI-based safety reports, driver behavior analytics, and policy recommendations — making it valuable to transport authorities, platforms, and insurers.

🤝 4. Partnership & Licensing
Opportunity to license feedback systems to ride-hailing startups, fleet operators, or local governments.

Scope to monetize via subscription models, premium driver profiles, or safety certifications.

🚀 Summary
As transportation evolves, passenger voice must evolve too.
TASC addresses a growing gap with timely innovation, social value, and commercial potential in both urban mobility and transport regulation.
